2019-12-01	Computational Methodology for the Allocation of Work and Interaction in Human-Robot Teams	Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making	"This paper presents a three-phase computational methodology for making informed design decisions when determining the allocation of work and the interaction modes for human-robot teams. The methodology highlights the necessity to consider constraints and dependencies in the work and the work environment as a basis for team design, particularly those dependencies that arise within the dynamics of the team’s collective activities. These constraints and dependencies form natural clusters in the team’s work, which drive the team’s performance and behavior. The proposed methodology employs network visualization and computational simulation of work models to identify dependencies resulting from the interplay of taskwork distributed between teammates, teamwork, and the work environment. Results from these analyses provide insight into not only team efficiency and performance, but also quantified measures of required teamwork, communication, and physical interaction. The paper describes each phase of the methodology in detail and demonstrates each phase with a case study examining the allocation of work in a human-robot team for space operations."

2019-3-01	An Integrated System for Mixed-Initiative Planning of Manned Spaceflight Operations	2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference	"Manned spaceflight in outer/deeper space will require crew operations that are independent of ground support. This requires the crew to re-plan day-to-day activities, particularly in the case of unforeseen circumstances. To support these planning duties, we are developing a mixed-initiative planning tool that optimizes schedules in collaboration with astronauts. This paper highlights the tool's planning algorithm. The planning algorithm has two closely-coupled components: first, an optimization algorithm (optimizer) based on local search heuristics and, secondly, a computational model of the work that is to be performed. In this framework, the optimizer acts as a surrogate model of the more detailed computational models, such that new solutions can be efficiently explored. The computational work model is capable of simulating a plan through time, and can account for dynamic interactions between activities and work environment that are not modeled in the optimizer. Moreover, the computational model returns to the optimizer metrics that reflect required teamwork to coordinate activities between astronauts. The paper includes a description of the optimizer and computational simulation models as well as a case study with activities, agents and resources that are representative of a typical manned mission."

2016-7-01	Computational Assessment of Authority and Responsibility in Air Traffic Concepts of Operation	Journal of Air Transportation	"This paper proposes a systematic approach to examine air traffic concepts of operation whose degree of innovation includes the potential for novel allocations of authority and responsibility between agents. The paper starts by demonstrating how concepts of operation can be modeled around the construct of actions, with accurate models of aircraft dynamics included as a common \{\textquotedblleft\}truth.\{\textquotedblright\} A case study is provided in this demonstration, examining merging and spacing of aircraft during arrival. Then, this paper discusses the specific fast-time computational simulation framework used here, and then applies the framework to the case study to illustrate how metrics of emergent behaviors can be collected via the simulation. Analysis of these metrics is framed within the construct of the coherence of the function allocation. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of further applications of this method of framing and analyzing concepts of operation, and further extensions to the method. This systematic, computational approach provides more definitive insights than a sole reliance on SMEs\{\textquoteright\} estimates or extrapolations of the merits and concerns with a concept of operations. Likewise, this approach can quickly test a wide range of concepts of operation. \n"	"Amy R. Pritchett and Raunak P. Bhattacharyya and Martijn IJtsma (2016).

2015-01-01	Computational Assessment of Different Air-Ground Function Allocations	Eleventh USA/Europe Air Traffic Management Research and Development Seminar	"NextGen and SESAR are redefining each agent's role in the airspace in terms of autonomy, authority and responsibility. Function allocation is the process of defining authority, i.e., which functions are executed by which agents. This is an essential design decision in creating transformative ATM concepts of operation. This paper presents a computational simulation methodology to assess function allocations in early design phases, before functional prototypes and HITL experiments can be developed. Thus, this method applies the same models of the functions regardless of which agent executes them, so that any observed effects can be isolated to the function allocation without confounds. A case study is presented in which ten potential function allocations within a new concept of operation were evaluated. A distinction is made between coherent and incoherent function allocations. The key metrics of the function allocations include the time history of each agent's task load and required information exchange with other agents. The results show that the coherency of a function allocation can have a pronounced effect on the amount of information requirements. The paper concludes with a discussion of how this method can be applied to other concepts of operation, and how this method can be used, after the early-in-design analysis described here, as an evolving computational analysis tool for more detailed evaluations using higher fidelity models."
