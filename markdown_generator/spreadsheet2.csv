2021-01-01	A Critical Examination of Autonomous Flight Safety Systems from a Cognitive Systems Engineering Perspective: Challenges, Themes, and Outlying Risks	Proceedings of the 72nd International Astronautical Congress (IAC)	"Flight safety systems (FSS) act as a method to terminate off-nominal rocket launches which threaten public safety. Traditional FSS delegate decision authority to an experienced Mission Flight Control Officer (MFCO) tasked with flight termination decisions, observing multiple points of telemetry data in real time to ensure nominal flight status. This study examines the engineering trade-offs, complexities, and pitfalls introduced by automating this key safety task through autonomous flight safety systems (AFSS). We approach this problem from a cognitive systems engineering perspective, connecting aspects of AFSS to existing literature in human-machine teaming and resilience engineering. Based on information gathered from a series of semi-structured interviews performed with various subject matter experts (mission controllers, regulators, engineers, amongst others) and existing literature, we outline a list of four assumptions underlying AFSS operations: [1] The system is fully autonomous, [2] An exhaustive flight safety analysis has been performed [3] The system will be able to respond appropriately to the world, and [4] MFCO expertise can be captured in (or translated to) software. Our findings highlight that, while the benefits of AFSS hold great promise for increasing the viability of commercial space operations, the automation of an irreversible, instantaneous, and complex decision-making task brings with it significant challenges and risks. We propose directions for further research to minimize the likelihood of errant, expensive, and dangerous flight terminations by an automated agent."

2018-9-01	Demonstration of the “Work Models that Compute” Simulation Framework for Objective Function Allocation	Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting	"This document describes a demonstration of the computational simulation framework Work Models that Compute (WMC). WMC is a framework for the objective evaluation of function allocation between humans and robots. The WMC framework has been used to study the impact of function allocation on both the air traffic management and spacecraft operations work domains. Recent advances include modeling of human-robot control modes, locomotion, failures and physical resources. We propose a demonstration of WMC showcasing how WMC can provide useful, objective and quantitative insight in the trade-offs asso-ciated with function allocation. In the demonstration, we will analyze function allocation for an on-orbit maintenance scenario. We will first show how minor changes to a function allocations can have major ef-fects on the emergent work patterns that result from the simulation framework. Second, we will demon-strate an analysis of 10-15 possible function allocations (defined in advance) and cross-compare their char-acteristics based on measures such as the idle time, taskload for each agent, information transfer require-ments, physical resources exchanges and others. This will show the framework’s capability to rapidly ex-plore the function allocation trade-space and allow the designer to make more informed trade-offs."	"Martijn IJtsma and Lanssie M.

2021-9-01	Modeling the Effects of Machine Rigidities on Joint Work Strategies	Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting	"One of the challenges in designing resilient human-machine systems is that machine capabilities are inherently rigid. A resilient joint cognitive system can anticipate and adapt to changing work demands effectively, but limitations of machines can make this adaptation constrained and less fluid. By identifying and accommodating for these rigidities in the design of human-machine system architectures, developers can build human-machine systems that support multiple contexts. This paper proposes a work-modeling approach for analyzing joint human-machine work strategies, focusing on identifying interdependencies that would support opportunistic adaptation and reduce the risk of machine rigidity leading to brittle failures of a human-machine system. The approach is applied to a case study in space operations to demonstrate how interdependencies can be identified and evaluated. The results of this analysis provide early insight into how team adaptation and machine limitations can be systematically accounted for in system architecture design."

2021-9-01	Requirements for Computational Approaches to Analyzing Resilience in Human-Machine Teams	Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting	"Human-machine teams (HMTs) in complex work domains need to be able to adapt to variable and uncertain work demands. Computational modeling and simulation can provide novel approaches to the evaluation of HMTs performing complex joint activities, affording large-scale, quantitative analysis of team characteristics (such as system architecture and governance protocols) and their effects on resilience. Drawing from literature in resilience engineering, human-automation interaction, and cognitive systems engineering, this paper provides a theoretical exploration of the use of computational modeling and simulation to analyze resilience in HMTs. Findings from literature are summarized in a set of requirements that highlight key aspects of resilience in HMTs that need to be accounted for in future modeling and evaluation efforts. These requirements include a need to model HMTs as joint cognitive systems, the need to account for the interdependent nature of activity, the temporal dynamics of work, and the need to support formative exploration and inquiry. We provide a brief overview of existing modeling and simulation approaches to evaluating HMTs and discuss further steps for operationalizing the identified requirements."

2022-1-01	Development of a Dynamic Model of Adaptation in Distributed Work Systems	AIAA SCITECH 2022 Forum	"Distributed work systems such as disaster response operations involve heterogeneous actors that need to coordinate to achieve a common goal. When operating in complex work domains, distributed work systems need to adapt their strategies and capabilities to meet varying and uncertain demands. Resilience engineering describes how distributed work systems respond to variable demands through managing adaptive capacity. This paper proposes a dynamic model of adaptation of a single unit of adaptive behavior in a distributed work system. The proposed model captures how managing one's adaptive capacity involves work, effort, and resources that can compete with efforts required to respond to immediate demands. The paper discusses the model and its theoretical foundations in the context of disaster response with unmanned aerial vehicles. Results from a simple numerical simulation experiment, examining three strategies for responding to increasing demands, illustrate how the model can be used to analyze dynamics of adaptation. Potential applications of this model are in research on complex, safety-critical operations, in which simulation can be used to analyze resilient control strategies, and operational settings, in which the models could be used in conjunction with operational data to better understand how adaptive capacity is managed."

This paper describes a combination of cognitive walkthroughs and computational modeling of work to analyze edge case scenarios and assess resiliency in future UTM operations. We discuss how the walkthrough and modeling inform each other and present early results. The ultimate goal of this work is to identify requirements for robust and resilient system responses in future UTM contingency management."	"Emily Barrett and Martijn IJtsma (2021).

2015-01-01	Computational Assessment of Different Air-Ground Function Allocations	Eleventh USA/Europe Air Traffic Management Research and Development Seminar	"NextGen and SESAR are redefining each agent's role in the airspace in terms of autonomy, authority and responsibility. Function allocation is the process of defining authority, i.e., which functions are executed by which agents. This is an essential design decision in creating transformative ATM concepts of operation. This paper presents a computational simulation methodology to assess function allocations in early design phases, before functional prototypes and HITL experiments can be developed. Thus, this method applies the same models of the functions regardless of which agent executes them, so that any observed effects can be isolated to the function allocation without confounds. A case study is presented in which ten potential function allocations within a new concept of operation were evaluated. A distinction is made between coherent and incoherent function allocations. The key metrics of the function allocations include the time history of each agent's task load and required information exchange with other agents. The results show that the coherency of a function allocation can have a pronounced effect on the amount of information requirements. The paper concludes with a discussion of how this method can be applied to other concepts of operation, and how this method can be used, after the early-in-design analysis described here, as an evolving computational analysis tool for more detailed evaluations using higher fidelity models."

2020-1-01	An Experimental Refinement of Computational Models of Human-Robot Teams	AIAA Scitech 2020 Forum	"This work aims to investigate methods to effectively design human-robot teams using computational working and simulation paired with a human-in-the-loop experiment (HITL). This HITL relates human-robot teaming fluency metrics (human idle time, robot idle time, and concurrent activity) to perceived workload. We also present a computational simulation that is able to predict these fluency metrics. We modeled an on-orbit maintenance scenario where participants interacted with either a robot capable of fetching and inspecting or just inspecting. To mimic a real space scenario, we also tested the differences between having participants listen to all mission control commands and confirmations versus omitting this dialogue. We found that participants rated a robot capable of fetching as a significantly better teammate even if this caused a slower overall scenario with less work for themselves. Robot idle time and concurrent activity were good predictors of how participants perceived the robot. However, more human idle time did not always correlate to lower perceived workload. Computational predictions of the relative effects different work allocations were confirmed by the experiment. Further, bootstrapping analysis demonstrated how the computational models can be further improved from HITL results, both in terms of refining estimates of specific activities and in terms of identifying other important effects to incorporate, such as communication times and the time to transition between actions."

2016-7-01	Computational Assessment of Authority and Responsibility in Air Traffic Concepts of Operation	Journal of Air Transportation	"This paper proposes a systematic approach to examine air traffic concepts of operation whose degree of innovation includes the potential for novel allocations of authority and responsibility between agents. The paper starts by demonstrating how concepts of operation can be modeled around the construct of actions, with accurate models of aircraft dynamics included as a common \{\textquotedblleft\}truth.\{\textquotedblright\} A case study is provided in this demonstration, examining merging and spacing of aircraft during arrival. Then, this paper discusses the specific fast-time computational simulation framework used here, and then applies the framework to the case study to illustrate how metrics of emergent behaviors can be collected via the simulation. Analysis of these metrics is framed within the construct of the coherence of the function allocation. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of further applications of this method of framing and analyzing concepts of operation, and further extensions to the method. This systematic, computational approach provides more definitive insights than a sole reliance on SMEs\{\textquoteright\} estimates or extrapolations of the merits and concerns with a concept of operations. Likewise, this approach can quickly test a wide range of concepts of operation. \n"	"Amy R. Pritchett and Raunak P. Bhattacharyya and Martijn IJtsma (2016).

2018-3-01	Modelling and evaluating failures in human-robot teaming using simulation	2018 IEEE Aerospace Conference	"As robotic capabilities improve and robots become more capable as equal team members, better understanding of effective human-robot teaming is needed. In this paper, we investigate failures by robots in various team configurations in space EVA operations. Our case study highlights our methodology for simulating task failures within human-robot teams and their impact on metrics of human-robot teamwork. This paper describes the methodology of extending and application of Work Models that Compute (WMC), a computational simulation framework, to cover locomotion, to model robot failures, interruptions, and the resolutions they require. Using these models, we investigate how different team configurations respond to a robot’s failure to correctly complete the task and overall mission. We highlight different metrics that these failures impact on team performance through varying components of teaming and interaction that occur. Finally, we discuss the future implications of this work and the future work to be done to investigate function allocation in human-robot teams."	"Lanssie M. Ma and Martijn IJtsma and Karen M.

2017-01-01	Modeling Human-Robot Interaction to Inform Function Allocation in Manned Spaceflight Operations	Robotics: Science and Systems; Workshop: Bridging the Gap in Space Robotics	"This paper demonstrates the use of a computational simulation framework called Work Models that Compute (WMC) to evaluate function allocations for human-robot teams in spaceflight operations. The focus is on the modeling and simulation of human-robot interaction associated with different control modes, as well as mismatches between authority and responsibility in the function allocation. The interactions required by these aspects of function allocation are modeled as various forms of teamwork actions. B y simulating the work dynamics of the taskwork, as well as the teamwork required for interaction, the simulation framework can provide objective measures of different function allocations given different modes of human-robot interaction. We specifically highlight a measure for the required communication between agents via different communication channels. A case study demonstrates the application of the simulation framework to an on-orbit maintenance scenario."	"Martijn IJtsma and Amy R Pritchett and Lanssie M Ma and Karen M Feigh (2017).

Given that as- tronauts have traditionally relied on ground-based mis- sion control to produce, manage, and adjust daily flight plans as needed, one such challenge will be the time lag in communications with mission control as a crew moves further away from the Earth. This will necessitate (automated) planning systems that will provide crews greater autonomy in managing and adapting plans to re- flect the current state of the mission. This paper details the progress our research team has made in developing a mixed-initiative plan management system for use on future missions to Mars and beyond. We describe the system’s design and intended capabilities and provide the results of some preliminary testing with small sam- ple plans."

2017-01-01	Adaptive Automation Based on Air Traffic Controller Decision-Making	International Symposium on Aviation Psychology	"Through smart scheduling and triggering of automation support, adaptive automation has the potential to balance air traffic controller workload. The challenge in the design of adaptive automation systems is to decide how and when the automation should provide support. This paper describes the design of a novel mechanism for adaptively invoking automation support. Whereas most adaptive automation support systems are reactive in that they invoke automation support after controller workload has increased, the aim of the designed mechanism is to proactively trigger automation support prior to workload increases. To do this, the mechanism assesses the quality of air traffic controller's decisions. The designed adaptive automation system has been tested in a human-in-the-loop experiment. Results indicate that the adaptive support helps to increase efficiency and safety as compared to manual control. However, lower triggering thresholds (resulting in more frequent automation intervention) increased the frustration level of participants (as measured with NASA TLX) and decreased acceptance of the support."

2019-01-01	Simulating Human-Robot Teamwork Dynamics for Evaluation of Work Strategies in Human-Robot Teams	International Symposium on Aviation Psychology	"To foster resilience in teams operating in complex work domains, design should allow for a range of work strategies as appropriate to context. This paper describes how computational simulation and network visualization of a team’s work can identify feasible work strategies and assess their appropriateness for different contexts. Network visualizations can identify constraints and dependencies that drive the feasible set of work strategies. After preliminary network analysis, these dependencies and inter-dependencies can be simulated in detail to better understand their impact. To illustrate, we describe a case study that explores two different work strategies that can each address the dependencies in a human-robot (rover) team in a manned space exploration mission."

2019-3-01	An Integrated System for Mixed-Initiative Planning of Manned Spaceflight Operations	2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference	"Manned spaceflight in outer/deeper space will require crew operations that are independent of ground support. This requires the crew to re-plan day-to-day activities, particularly in the case of unforeseen circumstances. To support these planning duties, we are developing a mixed-initiative planning tool that optimizes schedules in collaboration with astronauts. This paper highlights the tool's planning algorithm. The planning algorithm has two closely-coupled components: first, an optimization algorithm (optimizer) based on local search heuristics and, secondly, a computational model of the work that is to be performed. In this framework, the optimizer acts as a surrogate model of the more detailed computational models, such that new solutions can be efficiently explored. The computational work model is capable of simulating a plan through time, and can account for dynamic interactions between activities and work environment that are not modeled in the optimizer. Moreover, the computational model returns to the optimizer metrics that reflect required teamwork to coordinate activities between astronauts. The paper includes a description of the optimizer and computational simulation models as well as a case study with activities, agents and resources that are representative of a typical manned mission."

This dissertation argues that from the start team design needs to establish team structures that allow flexibility in strategies for conducting the team’s collective work. In addition, team design needs to facilitate fluent coordination of work, fostering the interweaving of team members’ dependent actions in ways that accounts for the dynamic characteristics of the work and the work environment. This dissertation establishes a methodology to analyze a team’s strategies based on computational modeling of a team’s collective work, including the teamwork required to coordinate dependent work between multiple team members. This approach consists of the systematic identification of feasible work strategies and the simulation of work models to address the dynamic and emergent nature of a team’s work. It provides a formative analysis tool to help designers predict and understand the effects of their design choices on a team’s feasible work strategies. Two case studies on space operations demonstrate how this approach can predict how work allocation and human-robot interaction modes can foster and/or limit the availability of appropriate work strategies."

2019-12-01	Computational Methodology for the Allocation of Work and Interaction in Human-Robot Teams	Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making	"This paper presents a three-phase computational methodology for making informed design decisions when determining the allocation of work and the interaction modes for human-robot teams. The methodology highlights the necessity to consider constraints and dependencies in the work and the work environment as a basis for team design, particularly those dependencies that arise within the dynamics of the team’s collective activities. These constraints and dependencies form natural clusters in the team’s work, which drive the team’s performance and behavior. The proposed methodology employs network visualization and computational simulation of work models to identify dependencies resulting from the interplay of taskwork distributed between teammates, teamwork, and the work environment. Results from these analyses provide insight into not only team efficiency and performance, but also quantified measures of required teamwork, communication, and physical interaction. The paper describes each phase of the methodology in detail and demonstrates each phase with a case study examining the allocation of work in a human-robot team for space operations."

2015-01-01	Computational Simulation of Authority-Responsibility Mismatches in Air-Ground Function Allocation	International Symposium on Aviation Psychology	"Authority-responsibility mismatches are created when one agent is authorized (has authority) to perform an activity, but a different agent is responsible for its outcome. An authority-responsibility mismatch demands monitoring by the responsible agent that itself requires additional information transfer and taskload. This paper demonstrates a computational simulation methodology that identifies when mismatches will occur in complex, multi-agent aviation operations, and their implications for information transfer between agents and task demands on each agent. A case study examines 25 authority and responsibility allocations in a NextGen/SESAR scenario in a terminal area where authority and responsibility for activities involving optimal profile descents, merging and spacing can be fluidly allocated to the aircraft (pilot/flight management system) or to the ground (air traffic controller/controller decision aids and automation)."
