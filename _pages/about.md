I am an assistant professor in the Integrated Systems Engineering department at the Ohio State University (OSU) with a courtesy appointment in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. My research interests evolve around operations of heterogeneous multi-agent systems in naturalistic, high-complexity environments. This includes research on human-AI/robot teaming (HART) and technology-supported human-human coordination and collaboration to improve the safety and resilience of high-stakes operations. This research contributes to a variety of domains of practice, such as air traffic management, spaceflight operations, smart mobility, and disaster response operations. 

I lead a group of graduate and undergraduate students as part of the [Cognitive Systems Engineering Lab (CSEL)](https://csel.engineering.osu.edu). See the [Research tab](https://u.osu.edu/csel/research-projects/) for an overview of specific (past and current) projects that my students and I work(ed) on. An overview of our publications can be found [here](https://mijtsma.github.io/publications/).
<!--As an important enabler of effective teaming, my students and I work on supporting coordination between humans and (semi-)autonomous agents to improve joint performance during time-critical events.  -->

I teach [several courses](https://mijtsma.github.io/teaching/) at the undergraduate and graduate levels. These courses are open to ISE/MAE students and students from other departments and majors. I encourage anyone interested in systems integration of human and AI/robotic capabilities to sign up for these courses. More courses, also ones offered by my colleagues on similar topics, can be found on the [CSEL course page](https://u.osu.edu/csel/cognitive-systems-engineering-courses/).

I am an active member of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES) and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).
