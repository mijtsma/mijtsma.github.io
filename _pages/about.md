**_&#9432;  Open undergraduate research positions:_**  ***I'm looking for two UG researchers to support our latest projects, for the remainder of SP24 semester (~10 hours/week) with an option to extend into SU24 (~20-30 hours/week). Full details on the position can be found [here](https://mijtsma.github.io/files/20240305_undergraduate_position_description.pdf).***

I am an assistant professor in the Integrated Systems Engineering department at the Ohio State University (OSU) with a courtesy appointment in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. My research centers on the design and operation of heterogeneous multi-agent systems in high-consequence, high-complexity environments. My lab develops new computational methods to support more effective human–AI/robot teaming (HART) and to strengthen coordination and collaboration within human teams. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance the safety and resilience of safety-critical operations through better systems design. 

My work contributes to a variety of application domains, including air traffic management, commercial flight deck operations, human spaceflight, and disaster response. 

I lead a team of talented graduate and undergraduate researchers in the [Cognitive Systems Engineering Lab (CSEL)](https://csel.engineering.osu.edu). You can explore our ongoing and past projects on the [Research page](https://mijtsma.github.io/current-projects/) and view our publications [here](https://mijtsma.github.io/publications/).

I teach [undergraduate and graduate courses](https://mijtsma.github.io/teaching/) open to students across ISE, MAE, and other departments. I encourage students interested in human-centered design, human systems integration, and AI/robotic capabilities to enroll. Additional related courses, including those taughts by CSEL colleagues, are listed on the [CSEL course page](https://u.osu.edu/csel/cognitive-systems-engineering-courses/).

I also serve as an Associate Editor for the *Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making*, Program Chair for the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting (ASPIRE), and am a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).
