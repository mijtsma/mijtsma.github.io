I am an assistant professor in the Integrated Systems Engineering department at the Ohio State University (OSU). I co-direct the Cognitive Systems Engineering Lab (CSEL) at OSU. My research is on human-autonomy teaming (HAT) to improve the safety and efficiency of complex and high-risk operations. HAT, in which humans and AI/robotic agents work jointly towards shared goals, applies to a wide variety of domains, such as spaceflight operations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) operations, and autonomous driving. As an important characteristic of effective teaming, my students and I work on facilitating various coordination strategies between humans and (semi-)autonomous agents to improve joint performance during time-critical events.  See the “Research” tab on the CSEL website for an overview of specific (past and current) projects. An overview of my publications can be found here.

I teach a number of courses. These courses are open to ISE students and to students from other departments and majors. I encourage anyone who is interested in HAT to sign up for the courses listed here. More courses, also ones offered by my colleagues on similar topics, can be found on the CSEL course page.

I am an active member of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
