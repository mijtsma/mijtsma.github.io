Operations in complex work domains such as aviation and spaceflight involve multiple agents-human(s) and/or machine(s)-collaboratively working to achieve shared goals. The design and fielding of new automation and/or robotic technologies into these operations create shifts in roles and transformations of work that are often difficult to predict ahead of time. This includes changes to how multiple agents mutually organize their activity over time through coordination. To more effectively integrate human and technological capabilities in complex work domains, and to reduce risks of coordination breakdowns, computational modeling can help understand coordination requirements, including how powerful-yet-brittle technologies can support or disrupt effective coordination.

In this talk, I will discuss methods from work analysis and computational modeling for examining and supporting coordination between humans and machines in distributed work systems. These methods afford large-scale and fast-time exploration of trade spaces for distributed work systems, with applications in theory-building, design, verification and validation, and real-time operations. I will discuss insights gained from the models and two applications of these techniques as part of ongoing work at the Cognitive Systems Engineering Lab (CSEL): (1) the modeling of coordination strategies in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) to design support for responding to anomalies, and (2) modeling of joint work strategies in human-robot operations for manned spaceflight.
