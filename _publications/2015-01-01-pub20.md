title: "Computational Simulation of Authority-Responsibility Mismatches in Air-Ground Function Allocation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-01-01-pub20
excerpt: 'Authority-responsibility mismatches are created when one agent is authorized (has authority) to perform an activity, but a different agent is responsible for its outcome. An authority-responsibility mismatch demands monitoring by the responsible agent that itself requires additional information transfer and taskload. This paper demonstrates a computational simulation methodology that identifies when mismatches will occur in complex, multi-agent aviation operations, and their implications for information transfer between agents and task demands on each agent. A case study examines 25 authority and responsibility allocations in a NextGen/SESAR scenario in a terminal area where authority and responsibility for activities involving optimal profile descents, merging and spacing can be fluidly allocated to the aircraft (pilot/flight management system) or to the ground (air traffic controller/controller decision aids and automation).'

Authority-responsibility mismatches are created when one agent is authorized (has authority) to perform an activity, but a different agent is responsible for its outcome. An authority-responsibility mismatch demands monitoring by the responsible agent that itself requires additional information transfer and taskload. This paper demonstrates a computational simulation methodology that identifies when mismatches will occur in complex, multi-agent aviation operations, and their implications for information transfer between agents and task demands on each agent. A case study examines 25 authority and responsibility allocations in a NextGen/SESAR scenario in a terminal area where authority and responsibility for activities involving optimal profile descents, merging and spacing can be fluidly allocated to the aircraft (pilot/flight management system) or to the ground (air traffic controller/controller decision aids and automation).
