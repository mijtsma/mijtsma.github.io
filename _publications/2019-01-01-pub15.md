excerpt: 'This chapter proposes a methodology for human-robot function allocation for future space exploration mission that uses fast-time computational simulation. Dynamics of taskwork and teamwork often result in emergent work patterns that are difficult to predict from static analysis of function allocations. We model the dynamics of taskwork and teamwork and demonstrate our approach through a case study that explores the function allocation design space for an on-orbit maintenance mission involving humans and various robots. The case study highlights the method’s ability to predict possible concerns associated with limited availability of physical resources, action interdependencies, and communication requirements with possible time delays, and shows the influence of work dynamics on mission performance.'

This chapter proposes a methodology for human-robot function allocation for future space exploration mission that uses fast-time computational simulation. Dynamics of taskwork and teamwork often result in emergent work patterns that are difficult to predict from static analysis of function allocations. We model the dynamics of taskwork and teamwork and demonstrate our approach through a case study that explores the function allocation design space for an on-orbit maintenance mission involving humans and various robots. The case study highlights the method’s ability to predict possible concerns associated with limited availability of physical resources, action interdependencies, and communication requirements with possible time delays, and shows the influence of work dynamics on mission performance.
