collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-01-01-pub11
excerpt: 'This paper demonstrates the use of a computational simulation framework called Work Models that Compute (WMC) to evaluate function allocations for human-robot teams in spaceflight operations. The focus is on the modeling and simulation of human-robot interaction associated with different control modes, as well as mismatches between authority and responsibility in the function allocation. The interactions required by these aspects of function allocation are modeled as various forms of teamwork actions. B y simulating the work dynamics of the taskwork, as well as the teamwork required for interaction, the simulation framework can provide objective measures of different function allocations given different modes of human-robot interaction. We specifically highlight a measure for the required communication between agents via different communication channels. A case study demonstrates the application of the simulation framework to an on-orbit maintenance scenario.'

This paper demonstrates the use of a computational simulation framework called Work Models that Compute (WMC) to evaluate function allocations for human-robot teams in spaceflight operations. The focus is on the modeling and simulation of human-robot interaction associated with different control modes, as well as mismatches between authority and responsibility in the function allocation. The interactions required by these aspects of function allocation are modeled as various forms of teamwork actions. B y simulating the work dynamics of the taskwork, as well as the teamwork required for interaction, the simulation framework can provide objective measures of different function allocations given different modes of human-robot interaction. We specifically highlight a measure for the required communication between agents via different communication channels. A case study demonstrates the application of the simulation framework to an on-orbit maintenance scenario.
