excerpt: 'Distributed work systems such as disaster response operations involve heterogeneous actors that need to coordinate to achieve a common goal. When operating in complex work domains, distributed work systems need to adapt their strategies and capabilities to meet varying and uncertain demands. Resilience engineering describes how distributed work systems respond to variable demands through managing adaptive capacity. This paper proposes a dynamic model of adaptation of a single unit of adaptive behavior in a distributed work system. The proposed model captures how managing one&apos;s adaptive capacity involves work, effort, and resources that can compete with efforts required to respond to immediate demands. The paper discusses the model and its theoretical foundations in the context of disaster response with unmanned aerial vehicles. Results from a simple numerical simulation experiment, examining three strategies for responding to increasing demands, illustrate how the model can be used to analyze dynamics of adaptation. Potential applications of this model are in research on complex, safety-critical operations, in which simulation can be used to analyze resilient control strategies, and operational settings, in which the models could be used in conjunction with operational data to better understand how adaptive capacity is managed.'

Distributed work systems such as disaster response operations involve heterogeneous actors that need to coordinate to achieve a common goal. When operating in complex work domains, distributed work systems need to adapt their strategies and capabilities to meet varying and uncertain demands. Resilience engineering describes how distributed work systems respond to variable demands through managing adaptive capacity. This paper proposes a dynamic model of adaptation of a single unit of adaptive behavior in a distributed work system. The proposed model captures how managing one&apos;s adaptive capacity involves work, effort, and resources that can compete with efforts required to respond to immediate demands. The paper discusses the model and its theoretical foundations in the context of disaster response with unmanned aerial vehicles. Results from a simple numerical simulation experiment, examining three strategies for responding to increasing demands, illustrate how the model can be used to analyze dynamics of adaptation. Potential applications of this model are in research on complex, safety-critical operations, in which simulation can be used to analyze resilient control strategies, and operational settings, in which the models could be used in conjunction with operational data to better understand how adaptive capacity is managed.
