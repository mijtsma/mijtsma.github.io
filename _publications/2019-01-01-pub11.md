excerpt: 'To foster resilience in teams operating in complex work domains, design should allow for a range of work strategies as appropriate to context. This paper describes how computational simulation and network visualization of a teamâ€™s work can identify feasible work strategies and assess their appropriateness for different contexts. Network visualizations can identify constraints and dependencies that drive the feasible set of work strategies. After preliminary network analysis, these dependencies and inter-dependencies can be simulated in detail to better understand their impact. To illustrate, we describe a case study that explores two different work strategies that can each address the dependencies in a human-robot (rover) team in a manned space exploration mission.'
