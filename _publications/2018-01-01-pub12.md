excerpt: 'As humans endeavor to explore Mars and other celes- tial bodies further afield, we are faced with a bevy of challenges unique to deep space travel. Given that as- tronauts have traditionally relied on ground-based mis- sion control to produce, manage, and adjust daily flight plans as needed, one such challenge will be the time lag in communications with mission control as a crew moves further away from the Earth. This will necessitate (automated) planning systems that will provide crews greater autonomy in managing and adapting plans to re- flect the current state of the mission. This paper details the progress our research team has made in developing a mixed-initiative plan management system for use on future missions to Mars and beyond. We describe the system’s design and intended capabilities and provide the results of some preliminary testing with small sam- ple plans.'

As humans endeavor to explore Mars and other celes- tial bodies further afield, we are faced with a bevy of challenges unique to deep space travel. Given that as- tronauts have traditionally relied on ground-based mis- sion control to produce, manage, and adjust daily flight plans as needed, one such challenge will be the time lag in communications with mission control as a crew moves further away from the Earth. This will necessitate (automated) planning systems that will provide crews greater autonomy in managing and adapting plans to re- flect the current state of the mission. This paper details the progress our research team has made in developing a mixed-initiative plan management system for use on future missions to Mars and beyond. We describe the system’s design and intended capabilities and provide the results of some preliminary testing with small sam- ple plans.
