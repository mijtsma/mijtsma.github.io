excerpt: 'As robotic capabilities improve and robots become more capable as equal team members, better understanding of effective human-robot teaming is needed. In this paper, we investigate failures by robots in various team configurations in space EVA operations. Our case study highlights our methodology for simulating task failures within human-robot teams and their impact on metrics of human-robot teamwork. This paper describes the methodology of extending and application of Work Models that Compute (WMC), a computational simulation framework, to cover locomotion, to model robot failures, interruptions, and the resolutions they require. Using these models, we investigate how different team configurations respond to a robotâ€™s failure to correctly complete the task and overall mission. We highlight different metrics that these failures impact on team performance through varying components of teaming and interaction that occur. Finally, we discuss the future implications of this work and the future work to be done to investigate function allocation in human-robot teams.'
