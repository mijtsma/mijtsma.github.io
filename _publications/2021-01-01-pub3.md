title: "Modeling Contingency Management in Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-01-01-pub3
excerpt: 'Contingency management in future Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Traffic Management (UTM) requires a variety of distributed and interdependent functions and services—such as flight tracking and conformance monitoring, weather detection and prediction, and ground-based detection and avoidance— that need to be coordinated across multiple roles and organizations. This paper describes a combination of cognitive walkthroughs and computational modeling of work to analyze edge case scenarios and assess resiliency in future UTM operations. We discuss how the walkthrough and modeling inform each other and present early results. The ultimate goal of this work is to identify requirements for robust and resilient system responses in future UTM contingency management.'

Contingency management in future Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Traffic Management (UTM) requires a variety of distributed and interdependent functions and services—such as flight tracking and conformance monitoring, weather detection and prediction, and ground-based detection and avoidance— that need to be coordinated across multiple roles and organizations. This paper describes a combination of cognitive walkthroughs and computational modeling of work to analyze edge case scenarios and assess resiliency in future UTM operations. We discuss how the walkthrough and modeling inform each other and present early results. The ultimate goal of this work is to identify requirements for robust and resilient system responses in future UTM contingency management.
